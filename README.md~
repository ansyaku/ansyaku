## Bonjour, Hallo, Hey...  ðŸ‘‹


I'm not actively maintaining this repository. However, since some of my work need to stay still here and some things are easier to do here then I keep try to "make alive of this repo".
My active repo is in [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/andreas.syaloom.k).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some MATLAB Dynamic Stochastic General Equilbrium (DSGE), numerical method on macro model, and spatial analysis. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m still learning MATLAB.
- ðŸ‘¯ I mostly use R, Python, and STATA for coding.
- ðŸ¤” Most of my code is related to my work on (Computer Assisted Audit Technique (CAATs) and Data Analytics). Others are for learning and finisihing my university task.
- âš¡ Fun fact: 
  - I speak English, Indonesian, French. 
  - I understand a little bit Russian, Italian, German, and Spanish. 
  - This year I want to learn Portuguese (This is due to the fact that I visited Lisbon and Faro on February 2025 and I like the city immensely).
 
- ðŸ‘¯ Some of interesting repo of mine :
  - [12 Data Visualization with R](https://github.com/ansyaku/30DayChartChallenge) You can view the visualization by clicking the png file. This visualization is part of twitter challenge for creating 30 visualization in a month.
  - [Pelatihan Jarak Jauh Python untuk Data Analytics](https://gitlab.com/andreas.syaloom.k/2022-pjj-pythonda) A course for Ministry of Finance employee (organized by Badan Pendidikan dan Pelatihan Keuangan)) for enabling them to perform data analysis in their job. I taught 2.5 day / over 5 day collaborating with my fellow colleague in Inspektorat Jenderal Kementerian Keuangan. I covered 1st, 2nd day for Python Basics and 5th day concerning feature engineering. 
  - [Pelatihan Jarak Jauh Teknik Audit Berbantuan Komputer Menggunakan SQL](https://gitlab.com/andreas.syaloom.k/2023-pjj-tabk-sql)  A course for Inspectorate General - Ministry of Finance employee (organized by Badan Pendidikan dan Pelatihan Keuangan) for enabling them to perform data analysis during their audit assignment.
