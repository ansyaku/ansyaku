## Bonjour, Hallo, Hey...  ðŸ‘‹


I'm not actively maintaining this repository. However, since some of my work need to stay still here and some things are easier to do here then I keep try to "make alive of this repo".

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m still learning MATLAB.
- ðŸ‘¯ I mostly use R, STATA, and Python for coding.
- ðŸ¤” Most of my code is related to my work on (Computer Assisted Audit Technique (CAATs) and Data Analytics). Others are for learning and finisihing my university task.
