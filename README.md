## Bonjour, Hallo, Hey...  👋


I'm not actively maintaining this repository. However, since some of my work need to stay still here and some things are easier to do here then I keep try to "make alive of this repo".
My active repo is in Gitlab.

What 
- 🔭 I’m currently working on some script on MATLAB Dynamic Stochastic General Equilbrium and also learning some numerical method on macro model. 
- 🌱 I’m still learning MATLAB.
- 👯 I do R, STATA, and Python coding.
- 🤔 I code mostly for working (Computer Assisted Audit Technique (CAATs) and Data Analytics), learning, and finisihing my university homework.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I speak English, Indonesian, French. I understand a little bit Russian, Italian, German, and Spanish. My project on 2025 is to learn Portuguese.
