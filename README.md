## Bonjour, Hallo, Hey...  ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**ansyaku/ansyaku** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm not actively maintaining this repository. However, since some of my work need to stay still here and some things are easier to do here then I keep try to "make alive of this repo".
My active repo is in Gitlab.

What 
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some script on MATLAB Dynamic Stochastic General Equilbrium and also learning some numerical method on macro model. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m still learning MATLAB.
- ğŸ‘¯ I do R, STATA, and Python coding.
- ğŸ¤” I code mostly for working (Computer Assisted Audit Technique (CAATs) and Data Analytics), learning, and finisihing my university homework.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I speak English, Indonesian, French. I understand a little bit Russian, Italian, German, and Spanish. My project on 2025 is to learn Portuguese.
