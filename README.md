## Bonjour, Hallo, Hey...  ðŸ‘‹


I'm not actively maintaining this repository. However, since some of my work need to stay still here and some things are easier to do here then I keep try to "make alive of this repo".
My active repo is in [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/andreas.syaloom.k).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some script on MATLAB Dynamic Stochastic General Equilbrium (DSGE) and also learning some numerical method on macro model. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m still learning MATLAB.
- ðŸ‘¯ I mostly use R, STATA, and Python for coding.
- ðŸ¤” Most of my code is related to my work on (Computer Assisted Audit Technique (CAATs) and Data Analytics). Others are for learning and finisihing my university task.
- âš¡ Fun fact: 
  - I speak English, Indonesian, French. 
  - I understand a little bit Russian, Italian, German, and Spanish. 
  - My project on 2025 is to learn Portuguese.
